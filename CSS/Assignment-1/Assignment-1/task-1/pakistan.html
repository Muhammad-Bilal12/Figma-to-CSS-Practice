    <h1>Pakistan</h1>
    <p>
      After independence in 1947, Jinnah,<i>
        the President of the Muslim League</i
      >, became the nation's first <b>Governor-General</b> as well as the first
      President-Speaker of the Parliament, but he died of tuberculosis on 11
      September 1948. Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding fathers agreed to appoint
      Liaquat Ali Khan, the secretary-general of the party, the nation's first
      Prime Minister. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a monarchy within the
      Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic.

      With Pakistan surrendering in the war, Yahya Khan was replaced by
      <b> Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</b> as president; the country worked towards
      promulgating its constitution and putting the country on the road to
      democracy. Democratic rule resumed from <i>1972 to 1977</i> an era of
      self-consciousness, intellectual leftism, nationalism, and nationwide
      reconstruction.[107] In 1972 Pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to
      develop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of preventing any
      foreign invasion; the country's first nuclear power plant was inaugurated
      in that same year.[108][109] Accelerated in response to India's first
      nuclear test in 1974, this crash program was completed in 1979.
