            The word Haryali literally means greenery attributed to the green color of this chicken. A tikka is usually a bite-size grilled boneless meat or paneer. Since chicken is called murgh in Urdu and Hindi, Hariyali chicken and Hariyali murgh are the same things.
            This delicious chicken originated in Northern India, in the region of Punjab. In this region cilantro and mint-based green chutney (dipping sauce) is very popular. This chicken is an extended version of green chutney.</blockquote>
