            I grew up eating in cars. As a little kid visiting Karachi from Jeddah my vacations were punctuated by trips to Boat Basin. As a teen living in Karachi my Boat Basin loyalties became divided as I discovered the magic of Boti Rolls or Chicken Paratha Rolls. That slightly crisp fried poori paratha stuffed with spiced mirchi chicken, the slightly oozy chutneys, the crisp onions. That was my jam. I could eat two, no problem. God bless the metabolism that allowed me to. Over and over again.
