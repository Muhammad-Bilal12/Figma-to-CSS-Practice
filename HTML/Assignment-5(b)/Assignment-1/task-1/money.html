    <h1>History of Money</h1>
    <p>
      The <b>history of money</b> is the development over time of systems for
      the exchange, storage, and measurement of wealth. Money is a means of
      fulfilling these functions indirectly and in general rather than directly,
      as with barter. Money may take a physical form as in coins and notes, or
      may exist as a written or electronic account. It may have intrinsic value
      <i>(commodity money)</i>, or be legally exchangeable for something with
      intrinsic value <i>(representative money)</i>, or only have nominal value
      <i>(fiat money)</i>.

      The significant evidence establishes many things were traded in ancient
      markets that could be described as a medium of exchange. These included
      livestock and grain–things directly useful in themselves–but also merely
      attractive items such as cowrie shells or beads
      <sup>[citation needed]</sup> which were exchanged for more useful
      commodities. However, such exchanges would be better described as barter,
      and the common bartering of a particular commodity
      <i>(especially when the commodity items are not fungible)</i> does not
      technically make that commodity <b>"money"</b> or a "commodity money" like
      the shekel – which was both a coin representing a specific weight of
      barley, and the weight of that sack of barley
